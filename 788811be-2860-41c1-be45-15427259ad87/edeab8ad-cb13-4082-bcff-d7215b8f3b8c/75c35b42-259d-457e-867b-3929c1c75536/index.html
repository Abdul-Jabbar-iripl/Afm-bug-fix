                       <li>Avgas is a gasoline-based fuel used in piston-type engines. It was initially developed for military use and subsequently spread to commercial applications. Today, Avgas is used mainly by small aeroplanes and light helicopters. Still, many military and civilian transports are also powered by large piston engines that use Avgas. Two main specifications cover Avgas: ASTM D 910 and DEF STAN 91-90. Grades of Avgas are identified by their nominal minimum lean-mixture antiknock rating(s). Grade 100LL (100 Octane Low Lead) is the most popular grade of Avgas, whereas Grade 100 (100 Octane) and Grade 80 (80 Octane) are used sparingly.</li>

                          As microbes are naturally present in storage and distribution systems, microbial growth in aviation fuel systems can lead to rapidly accelerated corrosion, filter blocking, and increased levels of tank contamination, requiring more frequent cleaning.

                          The number of tests performed on jet fuel decreases as the product moves closer to the airport. This is because as the product gets close to the airport, it is transported by a dedicated system.

                        <li>
                        Field tests are performed at the terminals, airport depot and into-plane to ensure that the fuel's physical properties have not changed as the jet fuel is transported across the supply chain.

                          A membrane filtration test is generally carried out from a point immediately downstream of filter vessels to ascertain the functioning of the filters. It is a measure of the particulate contamination of aviation fuels.   </li>

                          Aircraft refuelling is a serious task carried out by trained in-plane operators or aircraft technicians. Refuelling an aircraft is a process where trained personnel carry out a job to fill an aircraft with fuel to enable the aircraft to fly to the next destination.                        </li>

                        <li>

                          On-time performance is an essential clause in a fuel supply agreement with airlines. Before the wheels of an aircraft have even touched the ground, a parking stand has been allocated, and refuelling equipment and the operator are waiting to refuel the aircraft for its next flight.
