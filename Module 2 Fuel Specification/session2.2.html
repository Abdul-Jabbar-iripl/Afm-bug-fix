                      <li>Description of the Test: The sample is taken in a one-litre bottle and twirled to create a vortex. Free water and particulate matter would settle at the bottom of the vortex, whereas the hazy appearance of the sample would indicate suspended water.

Prior to this, the top layer of gel had been treated with fluorescent dyes. Isopropyl alcohol is used to transport the sample and the fluorescent dyes down the column. The hydrocarbons separate into bands of aromatics, olefins, and saturates because of their different affinities for the gel.

Temperatures for 50% recovery and 90% recovery by volume are also to be reported.  </li>
                  <li>Description of Test: A 100-ml sample is placed in a round-bottom flask and heated at a rate specified for the sample's vapour pressure characteristics. Vapour temperatures are recorded when the first drop of condensate is collected (initial boiling point) and at recovered volumes of 5 ml, 10 ml, 15 ml, 20 ml, and every subsequent 10-ml interval to 80 ml, 85 ml, 90 ml, 95 ml, and at the end of the test (end point).

  <li>Test Method: IP 227
  </li>
  <li>Acceptable Limits: 1 (maximum) for 4 hours at 50 oC.

  </li>
  <li>Description of Test: A polished silver strip is immersed in a sample for two hours at 50°C and then removed and washed. The condition of the copper surface is qualitatively evaluated by comparing it to standards.</li></ul>
<p>  </p>
<ul class="comanlist">
<h2 class = "comanh2">2.2.18  THERMAL STABILITY
</h2>
<li>Significance: Thermal stability is one of the most critical jet fuel properties because the fuel serves as a heat exchange medium in the engine and airframe. Jet fuel removes heat from engine oil, hydraulic fluid, and air conditioning equipment. The heating of the fuel accelerates the reactions that lead to gum and particulate formation. Thermal stability relates to the amount of deposits formed in the engine fuel system at high temperatures.</li>
<li>Test Method: ASTM D 3241: Thermal Oxidation Stability of Aviation Turbine Fuels (JFTOT Procedure)</li>
<li>Test Method: ASTM D 3241: Thermal Oxidation Stability of Aviation Turbine Fuels (JFTOT Procedure)</li>
<li>Description of the Test: Fuel is pumped over a heated aluminium alloy tube at a constant flow rate for 2.5 hours. After contacting the tube, the fuel is filtered to collect any solid decomposition products. The pressure drop across the filter is monitored during the test. At the end of the test, the tube is removed and visually examined for any stain or discolouration, which is rated by comparing it to a standard colour scale. This visual tube rating and the pressure drop across the filter at the end of the test are reported as the test result.</li></ul>
<p>  </p>
<ul class="comanlist">
<h2 class = "comanh2">2.2.19 EXISTENT GUM</h2>
<li>Significance: Existent gum is a non-volatile residue left after the evaporation of fuel. It also serves as a check for fuel contamination within the product distribution system.</li>
<li>Test Method: ASTM D 381: Gum Content in Fuels by Jet Evaporation
</li>
<li>Acceptable Limits: 7 mg (maximum) per 100 ml.
</li>
<li>Description of the Test: A measured quantity of fuel is transferred to a weighed beaker, placed in a heated bath, and evaporated under a flow of steam. The resulting residue is weighed and reported as existing gum</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<ul class="comanlist">

<h2 class = "comanh2">2.2.20 	 WATER REACTION
</h2>
<li>Significance: Water reaction determines the presence of materials that react with water and affect the stability of the fuel-water interface.</li>
<li>Test Method: ASTM D 1094, Water Reaction of Aviation Fuels
</li>
<li>Acceptable Limits: 1 b (maximum).
</li>
<li>Description of the Test: A sample is shaken with an aqueous buffer solution in a clean glass cylinder at ambient temperature and then allowed to stand to let the mixture separate into hydrocarbon and aqueous phases. After five minutes of standing, the change in volume of the aqueous layer is measured. The appearance of the hydrocarbon/aqueous interface is also examined for the presence of bubbles or film.</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<ul class="comanlist">

<h2 class = "comanh2">2.2.21	WATER SEPARABILITY
</h2>
<li>Significance: The Water Separation Index rates the ability of the fuel to release entrained or emulsified water when passed through a fibreglass filter coalescer and affects the settling of water in jet fuel.</li>
<li>Test Method: ASTM D 3948: Determining Water Separation Characteristics of Aviation Turbine Fuels by Portable Separometer Using a semiautomatic micro-separometer instrument</li>
<li>Acceptable Limits: 70 (minimum).
</li>
<li>Description of the Test: A fuel sample is mixed with water, forced through a fibreglass coalescing medium, and rated. The MSEP rating indicates the relative ease of coalescing water from the sample. The instrument is calibrated with a water-free fuel sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<ul class="comanlist">

<h2 class = "comanh2">2.2.22	ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY</h2>
<LI>Significance: The electrical conductivity of the jet needs to be high enough to dissipate any electrostatic charges generated during fuel handling operations to prevent fire or explosion hazards.</LI>
<li>Test Method: ASTM D 2624: Electrical Conductivity of Aviation and Distillate Fuels
</li>
<li>Acceptable Limits: 50–450 picosiemens per metre (or conductivity unit)
</li>
<li>Description of the Test: A sample is placed in a cell containing two electrodes. A voltage is applied across the electrodes, and the resulting current is expressed in terms of the conductivity of the sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<ul class="comanlist">

<h2 class = "comanh2">2.2.23	LUBRICITY.</h2>
<li>Significance: Jet fuel must possess a certain degree of lubricity because jet engines rely on the fuel to lubricate some moving parts in fuel pumps and flow control units.</li>
<li>Test Method: ASTM D 5001: Measurement of Lubricity of Aviation Turbine Fuels by the Ball-on-Cylinder Lubricity Evaluator (BOCLE)</li>
<li>Acceptable Limits: 0.85 mm (maximum) for civil aviation and 0.65 mm (maximum) for defence use.</li>
<li>Description of the Test: A non-rotating steel ball is held against a cylindrical ring. The cylindrical ring is rotated at a fixed speed while partially immersed in the fuel. At the end of the test, the ball is removed and examined for wear. The size of the wear scar is related to the lubricity of the fuel (a large wear scar means poor lubricity).</li>
